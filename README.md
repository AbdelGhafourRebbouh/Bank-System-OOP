## 🌱 Learning Notes

This project helped me to:

- Take conceptual knowledge of OOP and apply it in a structured project  
- Improve my code organization by dividing functionality into classes and screens  
- Understand how data can be saved and loaded from files in C++  
- Practice user input validation, error handling, and screen management

## 🔭 Where I Am Now

This project was my **first step into backend development** while I was still learning **frontend basics**.  
Now, I’ve moved forward to focus on **.NET (C#)** with the goal of becoming a **desktop application developer**, while keeping my foundation in **C++**.
